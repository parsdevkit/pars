| Time           | Date                  | Represents time-related data such as dates, times, or durations. |

**Notes:**

- Some types such as `UInt128`, `Int128`, `Float16`, and `Float128` do not have direct equivalents in JavaScript. They are represented using the closest available type, `Number`.
- `Blob` is represented as a `Blob` in JavaScript, suitable for handling binary data.
