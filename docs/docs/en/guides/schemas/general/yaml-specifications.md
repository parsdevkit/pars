# YAML Specifications


**Tips:**

* Use consistent indentation to improve readability.
* Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters around colons and quotation marks.
* Validate your YAML files to ensure they are syntactically correct.


**Additional Notes:**

* The Go struct and unmarshal method provided in the original query are used internally by the application to process YAML data. You don't need to worry about these for creating YAML headers.
* This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of YAML syntax. If you're new to YAML, refer to online resources or tutorials for a comprehensive introduction.


Remember, the key to creating valid YAML headers is to follow the correct structure, use proper indentation, and adhere to the specified value types for each field.
