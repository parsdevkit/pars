# Log Level Enum


## Summary
`LogLevelEnum` is an enumeration that defines various levels of logging verbosity. Each level represents the severity or importance of the messages that can be logged. This can be useful for filtering log messages based on their relevance and significance.


## Constants
### Silence
**Description**: No logging output. This level effectively silences all log messages.

### Verbose
**Description**: Logs detailed information that is typically useful for debugging and understanding the flow of the application. This includes low-level details that are usually too verbose for regular operation but can be helpful during development.

### Info
**Description**: Logs informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level. These messages provide general operational information that can be useful for understanding the state and behavior of the application.

### Warn
**Description**: Logs potentially harmful situations that are not immediately causing errors but might lead to problems. These messages indicate potential issues that should be looked into to prevent future errors.

### Error
**Description**: Logs error events that might still allow the application to continue running. These messages indicate serious issues that have occurred but are not necessarily fatal to the application's operation.

### Fatal
**Description**: Logs very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort. These messages indicate critical failures that require immediate attention and usually result in the termination of the application.
